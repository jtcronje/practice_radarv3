Frontend Technology Stack
Core Technologies

React 18+: Frontend library for building the user interface
Next.js: React framework providing server-side rendering, routing, and development infrastructure
TypeScript: Static type checking for improved code quality and developer experience

UI Components & Styling

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
Recharts: Composable charting library built on React components
Lucide React: Beautifully crafted open-source icons

Data Processing & Utilities

PapaParse: CSV parsing library for handling CSV file data
Lodash: Utility library for data manipulation
date-fns: Modern JavaScript date utility library

Backend & Data Architecture
MVP Phase: Direct CSV Processing
The initial MVP will use a lightweight approach to data processing:

Python: Used for data processing scripts
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library
CSV Files: Source data stored in CSV format
Python API Endpoints: Simple API endpoints to query and process CSV data
FastAPI: Lightweight API framework for serving data to the frontend

This approach allows for rapid development and deployment without the overhead of setting up a complete database system.
Planned Architecture: Supabase Integration
After the MVP phase, the system will transition to Supabase:

Supabase: Open source Firebase alternative with:

PostgreSQL Database: Robust relational database
RESTful API: Automatic API generation
Authentication: Built-in auth system
Real-time Subscriptions: For live data updates
Storage: For document storage
Edge Functions: Serverless functions



Migration Path

MVP Phase: Implement with direct CSV processing and Python endpoints
Data Modeling Phase: Design database schema and relationships
Migration Phase: Script data import from CSVs to Supabase PostgreSQL
API Integration Phase: Replace Python endpoints with Supabase API calls
Enhancement Phase: Leverage Supabase features like real-time updates and auth

Development Environment

Git: Version control
GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipelines
Docker: Containerization for development and deployment consistency
VS Code: Recommended IDE with extensions for React, TypeScript, and Tailwind
ESLint & Prettier: Code linting and formatting

Deployment Options

Vercel: Primary deployment target for Next.js frontend
Supabase Cloud: Managed Supabase instance
Alternative: Self-hosted options on AWS, GCP, or Azure
Docker Compose: Local development environment

Performance Considerations

Code Splitting: Implemented via Next.js for optimized bundle sizes
Static Generation: For stable dashboard components
Incremental Static Regeneration: For semi-dynamic content
Client-side Data Fetching: For highly dynamic, personalized content
Memoization: For expensive calculations

Security Considerations

Authentication: Role-based access control
Data Encryption: At rest and in transit
API Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse
Input Validation: To prevent injection attacks
Regular Security Audits: Ongoing security maintenance

Scalability Path
MVP Load Capabilities

Data Volume: Up to ~10,000 procedure records
Concurrent Users: 5-10 users
Update Frequency: Daily batch updates

Supabase Transition Benefits

Data Volume: Scales to millions of records
Concurrent Users: 100+ users
Update Frequency: Real-time or near real-time
Query Performance: Optimized via PostgreSQL capabilities
